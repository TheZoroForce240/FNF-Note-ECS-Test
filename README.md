# Note ECS test

Just something I did to try about an entity component system type thing for fnf/flixel since using a separate FlxSprite for each note can use a lot of memory.

Also if you wanna try to compile make sure you add your own song/chart, it uses the legacy fnf / psych chart format, charts go in 'data/charts/songname/songname-songdiff.json' and songs go in 'songs/songname/Inst.ogg', also need to change the song/diff it loads in playstate by editing the string. While in game keybinds are DFJK and you can press Space to swap the scroll.
